# SurrogateMinimalDepth
In this R package functions are provided to select important variables with surrogate minimal depth (SMD) and mimimal depth (MD) and to investigate variable relations with the mean adjusted agreement of surrogate variables.

# Example data
Example data to apply the functions in this package is provided: 

The dataset contains 100 individuals (rows), 1 dependent variable (first column, y), and 200 additional variables (columns 2 to 201): For the simulation of the 200 additional variables nine variables X1,â€¦,X9 called basic variables were simulated. X1 to X6 are causal with constant effect sizes of 1 and X7 to X9 are noncausal with effect size of 0. The outcome y is a linear combination of the causal predictor variables and a normally distributed error term. All basic variables were sampled from a normal distribution (N(0,1)) just like the noise (N(0,0.2)). For each of the six basic variables X1, X2, X3, X7, X8, and X9 ten variables with predefined correlations of 0.9 for X1 and X7, 0.6 for X2 and X8, and 0.3 for X3 and X9 were obtained by simulateModule function of the R package WGCNA. The ten variables of each basis variable are labeled: Cp_basicvariable_number. Additional non-correlated and independent predictor variables (cgn) were simulated using the standard normal distribution to reach a total number of 200 variables.
